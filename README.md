# HCE - Shelly's Tool Kit
A command line tool-set for use with the Halo Custom Edition Editing Kit, made to automate and cut down on tasks that normally require a lot of time consuming manual work in different programs, without creative interference.

This helps people who make things for the game by cutting down the work they need to do. Which is important as development is usually handled by only a really small team or single person.

This project requires the reclaimer library, you can get it by downloading the MEK.
